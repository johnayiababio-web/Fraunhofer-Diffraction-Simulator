# Fraunhofer-Diffraction-Simulator
This is my undergraduate project work at the University of Cape Coast, department of Physics.A MATLAB App that visualizes the Fraunhofer single-slit diffraction pattern. This application allows users to interactively explore how changes in wavelength, slit width, and screen distance affect the light intensity distribution.

The app is built using MATLAB's App Designer, providing a user-friendly graphical interface for a hands-on learning experience.

## Features

- **Interactive Simulation:** Adjust key parameters using sliders and see the diffraction pattern update in real-time.
- **Dynamic Plotting:** Displays the Fraunhofer diffraction intensity pattern, showing the central maximum and secondary maxima and minima.
- **Parameter Control:**

    - **Wavelength:** Change the wavelength of light from 380 nm (violet) to 750 nm (red), covering the entire visible spectrum.
    - **Slit Width:** Modify the width of the single slit from 10 μm to 100 μm.
    - **Screen Distance:** Adjust the distance between the slit and the screen from 1 m to 5 m.
- **Visible Light Spectrum:** A visual representation of the visible light spectrum is included for easy reference of different wavelengths.
- **Live Parameter Display:** The current values for Wavelength, Slit Width, and Screen Distance are displayed in a dedicated panel.
- **Welcome Message:** A detailed welcome message guides the user on how to use the application and what to expect.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites

- You must have a working installation of **MATLAB**.
- The app was developed using MATLAB's App Designer, so a recent version of MATLAB (R2016a or later) is recommended.

### Running the App

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git)
    ```
2.  Open MATLAB.
3.  Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.
4.  Run the main application file directly from the command window or by clicking the 'Run' button in the MATLAB editor:
    ```matlab
    FS_DIFFRACTION
    ```
5.  The app window will appear, and a welcome message will be displayed.
6.  Use the sliders in the "PARAMETER SETTINGS" panel to change the simulation values.
7.  Observe the live changes in the "DIFFRACTION PATTERN" plot.

## The Physics Behind the Simulation

The app simulates the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern, which occurs when the light source and the screen are at an effectively infinite distance from the diffracting slit. The intensity distribution for a single slit is given by the formula:

$$
I(\theta) = I_0 \left( \frac{\sin(\beta)}{\beta} \right)^2
$$

where:
- $I_0$ is the maximum intensity at the center of the pattern ($\theta = 0$).
- $\beta = \frac{\pi a \sin(\theta)}{\lambda}$ is the diffraction parameter.
- $a$ is the slit width.
- $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the light.
- $\theta$ is the angle from the central axis to a point on the screen.

The code calculates the intensity profile as a function of $\beta$ to generate the plot.

## Code Structure

The core of the application is a single MATLAB class file, `FS_DIFFRACTION.m`, generated by App Designer.

- **`properties`**: Defines the user interface components (sliders, axes, panels, etc.).
- **`methods (Access = private)`**:
    - `simulation(app)`: The main function that calculates the diffraction intensity pattern based on the current slider values and plots it on the `UIAxes`.
    - `showWelcomeMessage(app)`: A helper function that displays the initial information dialog.
    - `wavelengthToRGB(app, wavelength)`: A utility function to convert a given wavelength (in nm) to its corresponding RGB color, used for generating the visible light spectrum display.
- **`methods (Access = private)`**:
    - `startupFcn(app)`: Initializes the application, displays the welcome message, and generates the visible light spectrum plot.
    - `WavelengthnmSliderValueChanged(app, event)`: Callback function that triggers the simulation when the Wavelength slider is moved.
    - `SlitWidthmSliderValueChanged(app, event)`: Callback for the Slit Width slider.
    - `ScreenDistanceSliderValueChanged(app, event)`: Callback for the Screen Distance slider.
- **`methods (Access = public)`**:
    - `FS_DIFFRACTION`: The constructor that creates the app components and runs the startup function.
    - `delete(app)`: A destructor that handles the cleanup when the app is closed.
